"""
An implementation of Schoof's algorithm for counting the points of
elliptic curves over finite fields; the implementation avoids unnecessary
computations.

The implementation is faster than the naive version. Yet, it still uses naive
arithmetic and is badly suited for actual counting tasks. It demonstrates the
performance improvement from a smarter choice of moduli and reordered
computations.

@see Schoof, R.
"Elliptic Curves Over Finite Fields and the Computation of Square Roots mod p"
in Mathematics of Computation, Vol. 44, No. 170 (Apr. 1985), pp. 483--494.
